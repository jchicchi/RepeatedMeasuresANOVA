# RepeatedMeasuresANOVA
Repeated Measures ANOVA using Pingouin package in Python
A repeated measures ANOVA is used to determine whether or not there is a statistically significant difference between the means of three or more groups
in which you have the same subjects in each group.

The essential purpose of a two-way repeated measures ANOVA is to understand if there is an interaction between these two factors on the dependent variable.
